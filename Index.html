      <h2>Kernel</h2>
      <p>The kernel is the core component of our system, responsible for
      managing resources, handling requests, and interfacing between hardware
      and software layers. It ensures stability and performance across all
      operations and is designed to be extensible to accommodate future
      enhancements.</p>
      <p>As our project evolves, the kernel will gain additional modules for
      data processing, security, and high‑throughput communication.</p>
